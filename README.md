# IoT Time-Series Database Benchmarking Framework

This repository contains the full code, configurations, and scripts used in the benchmarking study from the paper:

> **"Performance Evaluation of SQL and NoSQL Time-Series Databases for IoT Data Ingestion and Querying"**  
> Evaluates ingestion speed, query latency, and optimization strategies across multiple database systems using synthetic IoT datasets.

The experiments compare relational, time-series, and NoSQL databases under identical workloads.  
Benchmarks include:
- **Raw ingestion** and **optimized ingestion**
- **Query latency** across six representative queries (Q1â€“Q6)
- Multiple dataset sizes (5 rows, 2,000 rows, 500,000 rows)
